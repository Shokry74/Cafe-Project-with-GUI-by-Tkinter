# Cafe-Project-with-GUI-by-Tkinter
This is a project for one of the coffee shops. The idea of the project is the presence of the menu in a simplified form to calculate the total number of orders from people at any time. This was done by the Tkinter library in Python. This is the first version, and it will be updated and developed further.
